# TrainLab
Added feature is the buttons turn red after they are pushed.

There will be a train sitting on a track between two blocks. To control the train we will have four objects to click. The first will move the train forward, the second will move it backwards, the third will stop the train, and the fourth will randomize what the other buttons will do. The train will be sitting on a landscape and will not be able to go through the objects.

The tasks are:
1. Create a landscape
2. Create the track and blocks at the end.
3. Create a simple train
4. Write the scripts for the trains buttons
5. Assign scripts to corresponding objects
